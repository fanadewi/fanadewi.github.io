## Hey There!

Welcome to my blog! I'm Ana, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself and my work here.

### Who Am I?

I'm a software engineer with over 6 years of experience, focusing on backend development with Golang. Alongside Golang, I'm skilled in technologies like Ruby, Java, SQL/NoSQL databases, Kafka, Redis, Docker, and Kubernetes.

### What Do I Do?

As a backend developer, my main job is to build and maintain the server-side of applications. I work on creating reliable and efficient systems, handling everything from data management to integrating various services. My goal is to make sure everything runs smoothly behind the scenes so users have a great experience.

### Why Am I Here?

I'm passionate about exploring new technologies and tackling interesting challenges. If you're into software development or just want to chat about tech, I'd love to connect!

Thanks for stopping by my blog. I hope you enjoy the posts and updates!
